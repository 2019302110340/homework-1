## **Homework 1**  

**1.What is the difference between a host and an end system?List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?**  

**2.Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are R1 and R2, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of Length L?(Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)**  

**3.Consider sending a packet from a source host to a destination host over a fixed route. List the delay components in the end-to-end delay. Which of there delays are constant and which are variable?**  

1.Answer: There is no difference. Throughout this text, the words “host"and “end system" areused interchangeably. End systems include PCs,workstations,Web servers，mail servers,lnternet-connected PDAs, WebTVs, etc.The web server also belongs to the end system。

2.Answer:L/R1 + L/R2

3.Answer:The delay components are processing delays,transmission delays,propagationdelays, and queuing delays. All of these delays are fixed, except for the queuing delays, which are variable.

## **Homework2**  

**1.Obtain the HTTP/1.1 specificationRFC(2616).Answer the following questions:  
a. Explain the mechaninsm used for signaling between the client and server to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed.Can the client, the server, or both signal the close of a connection?  
b. What encryption services are provided by HTTP?  
c. Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given server?  
d. Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it possible that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is transmitting data via this connection? Explain.**  

**2.Write a simple TCP program for a server that accepts lines of input from a client and prints the lines onto the server’s standard output. (You can do this by modifying the TCPServer.py program in the text.) Compile and execute your program. On any other machine that contains a Web browser, set the proxy server in the browser to the host that is running your server program; also configure the port number appropriately. Your browser should now send its GET request messages to your server, and your server should display the messages on its standard output. Use this platform to determine whether your browser generates conditional GET messages for objects that are locally cached.**  

1.a. Section 8 of RFC 2616 discusses persistent connections. In sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.2.1 of RFC, it indicates that either the server or the client will prompt the other party before closing the persistent connection, because before closing the connection, the server or the client will include the connection flag of "close" in the connection header field in the request message or response message

b.HTTP does not provide any encryption services

c. No.A single-user client should not maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy.  

d.Yes.When one party starts to close the connection, in its view, the connection is idle, but in the other party's view, the request or response is in progress

2.

```python  
from socket import
# set port number
serverPort=8000
serverSocket=socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM)
serverSocket.bind(('',serverPort))
serverSocket.listen(1)
while 1:
    connectionSocket.addr = serverSocket.accept()
    sentence = connectionSocket.recv(1024)
    print 'From Server:', sentence, '\n'    
    serverSocket.close()
```
